Overview
--------

NaughtySVN (NSVN) is an easy-to-use GUI based Subversion client which
works as an extension to Nautilus File Manager (Graphical shell for
the GNOME desktop environment). Inspired by TortoiseSVN, Its an effort
primarily for non-technical people to use subversion.

NSVN has a graphical interface which can be activated from Nautilus
file browsing window. Its graphical windows are designed to be simple and
easy to use, which  will allow users to create and administer subversion
repository, checkout and commit working copies, handling working copies,
browsing repositories and working copies, handling remote repositories and
working copies etc.

Dependencies
------------

The following packages and libraries are required by NaughtySVN:

  * Gnome 1.4

  * Subversion 1.2

  * libsvn_client-1

  * libsvn_repos-1

  * libsvn_subr-1

  * libsvn_fs-1

  * libsvn_wc-1

  * Nautilus 2.9.0

  * libNautilus-Extension 2.9.0

  * GLib 2.0

  * GModules 2.0

  * GThread 2.0

  * GTK 2.0

  * LibGnome 2.0

  * LibGnomeUI 2.0

  * Gnome-VFS 2.0

  * Gnome-VFS-Module 2.0

  * LibGlade 2.0

  * libpng 3.0

  * Apache 2.0

  * libapr 0.9.6

  * libaprutil 0.9.6

  * libdb 4.3

  * neon 0.24.7

For development purposes you will also need libglade-gnome.
Note: On Debian Etch systems it is impossible to install out of the box
both libglade-gnome0-dev and libsvn-dev due to a conflict between dependend
upon libraries. In order to install them side by side you will have to
modify an existing libdb4.4-dev deb package to add "libdb3-dev" to the
Provides: field of the package. You can do this by editing DEBIAN/control
after running "deb-reversion -k /bin/sh libdb4.4-dev_*.deb". When done, exit
and install with "dpkg -i libdb4.4-dev*LOCAL*.deb" the newly created
libdb4.4-dev package.

---------------------
Building & Installing
---------------------

See ./INSTALL for a details building and installation document. Following
is a simple way to build and install NSVN. Subversion include and library
paths are all  hard coded, so in case of problems please make appropriate
changes in ./svn/Makefile.am.

   1. 'cd' to top most directory of NSVN and type './autogen.sh'

   2. 'make' to compile NSVN

   3. 'make install' to install NSVN.

   4. 'pkill -9 nautilus' kill all nautilus instances

   Note:- Developers can use 'make installdev' for installing and restarting nautilus.
   
----------------------------
What happens on installation
----------------------------

'make install' will install NSVN in following order

 - Shared and static libraries from nautilus module of NSVN
   will be copied to nautilus_extension loadable module directory.
   Installation script retrieves the nautilus extension directory using
   'pkg-config' tool and file 'libnautilus-extension.pc'.

    * nautilus/libnautilus-naughtysvn.so will be copied to
      nautilus_extension_libdir/nautilus/extensions-1.0/

    * nautilus/libnautilus-naughtysvn.la will be copied to
      nautilus_extension_libdir/nautilus/extensions-1.0/

    * nautilus/libnautilus-naughtysvn.a will be copied to
      nautilus_extension_libdir/nautilus/extensions-1.0/


 - Shared and static libraries from svn module of NSVN will be
   copied to default library directory. Then svn module header file
   will be copied to default include directory.

    * svn/libsvn-naughtysvn.so will be copied to $libdir

    * svn/libsvn-naughtysvn.la will be copied to $libdir

    * svn/libsvn-naughtysvn.a will be copied to $libdir

    * svn/svn_naughtysvn.h will be copied to $includedir

 - NaughtySVN executable, user interface glade and pixmaps
   files will be copied to default bin directory, default share
   or data directories

   * nsvn/naughtysvn will be copied to $bindir

   * nsvn/naughtysvn.glade will be copied to gladedir


------------------
Invocation/Running
------------------

NaughtySVN is tightly coupled with subversion and nautilus and is not
designed to invoke it separately from command line. But in the interest
of developers and to test svn and nsvn modules faster, they can call
the 'naughtysvn' executable from command line use following format

   naughtysvn MID=NSVN CMD=command list_of_arguments ...

   where 'MID=NSVN' is a magic id used to transfer NSVN related data
from Nautilus to NSVN, 'command' is the command to be executed by nsvn
and 'list_of_arguments' are list of arguments need to execute the command
separated by space. for example:

   naughtysvn MID=NSVN CMD=create_repos /tmp/repos

 Nautilus default behaviour per today is to scan all directories and files
 when opening a new view (unviewed directectory). It then keeps a cache of the
 directory status (emblemes) for the rest of the session, even if the user
 hits CTRL-R, only the files will refresh. I have sent an email to the
 nautilus mailinglist about this behavour. If there is no possible way to
 refresh directories aswell, some tricks has to be used
 
 * If a user refreshes the view inside a directory, we can update the parent
   directory
 * We can add "Refresh status" to the menu that appears when the user
   right-clicks on a directory.
 * svn update, svn add etc from naughtysvn implementation can tell "this" code
   that emblems should be updated.



 Emblems Specification
 ---------------------

 * Keyword should be in UTF8 and can contain alpha numeric and space.
 * Keyword should not be symbolic-link, noread, nowrite, trash, note, desktop,
   these list are all reserved names.



 How to set emblems
 ------------------
 include <nautilus-file-info.h>

 make a call to
 nautilus_file_info_add_emblem (NautilusFileInfo *file, 
                                const char       *emblem_name);
